Thus, historical dynamics experienced particular clade evolution crucial understand current patterns, many significant historical influences widely distributed imprinted across extant phylogenies. Alternatively, solely focusing macroevolution dynamics overlooks important complex patterns emerge due biogeographical processes. instance, dynamics may differ among assemblages due various constraints experienced time, resulting distinct phylogenetic histories stored within . However, dissecting phylogenies comprehend contributions cladogenesis events different depths given pattern challenging now, given lack tools readily providing type information. primary goal treesliceR provide wide range functions capable cutting phylogenies evolutionary depth (Figure 1). cutted phylogenies can used users explore various evolutionary patterns stored different temporal depths, well information derived pruned phylogenies. ensure accessible user-friendly processes obtaining pruned phylogenies, treesliceR functions offer multiple criteria making slices based users requirements. instance, enables users cut phylogenies different orientations, ‘rootwardly’ (root tips) ‘tipwardly’ (tips root), simply obtain phylogenetic slice within specific time interval interest. Alternatively, multiple phylogenetic slices equal width can produced, similar time-series, based user-input temporal criteria, can expressed either millions years terms phylogenetic diversity. Figure 1: figure provides illustrated examples functions slicing phylogenies available within treesliceR. red dashed lines indicate hypothetical temporal thresholds input user. second goal treesliceR provide functions facilitate assessment novel family rates accumulation time phylogenetic index (Figure 2). rationale behind rates currently available indexes differentiate contributions lineages different depths given observed pattern. implies value particular phylogenetic index can obtained different configurations species compositions tree topologies. instance, high phylogenetic diversity observed within assemblage result deep lineages high richness recent lineages. Therefore, treesliceR offers functions calculating accumulation given phylogenetic pattern (e.g., PD, PE, Pβ…) time elucidate main lineages depths responsible generating . detailed information regarding mathematical procedures behind rates, please refer Araujo et al. (review). Figure 2: figure provide illustrated examples available functions calculating rates accumulation phylogenetic indexes, assessing parsimonious number slices model rates (.e., sensitivity analysis), presenting graphical outputs. figure demonstrates functions obtaining rates accumulations phygeloenetic β-diversity (Cpβ) example, rates can also applied phylogenetic indexes (details, see treesliceR CRAN). treesliceR easy--use open-access R package continuously evolving, goal becoming standard toolbox users interested temporally dissecting phylogenetic information. strives continually develop innovative methods reveal previously concealed phylogenetic patterns evolutionary time. package developed following user-friendly software development practices, offering functions core parallelization, detailed error messages case failures, graphical functions can rapidly generate ready--publish figures.
